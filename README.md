Filters work like this:
Apply location, feature and type filters ONLY AFTER click on Search button.
Location is a text input field according to the task, filter searches for any matches in lower case.
other filters work on backend. pagination 4 items per page even with location filter which is applied on client side.
if you move between pages, it remembers your filters and the exact place you have been on the page.
